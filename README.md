# Important

1. set the random seed

# Models to be Assessed

1. DistilHuBERT
2. Wav2Vec2
3. HuBERT  ---> batch_size -->25, 32 --> ran into OOM error + batch_size =18 --> 1h 40m

# Constraints to be Assessed

1. Model Performance
2. Training Time
3. Amount of Overfitting, train_loss, val_loss
4. other metrics
